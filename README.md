# A basic boilerplate for full-stack development

This is a basic boilerplate for full-stack development consisting of:

1. a Single-Page-Application template for the front end;
2. an Express REST architecture for the data storage (JWT protected).
3. a seeder for the mongodb database

The file `./server/config.js` is supposed to be used for setting configuration information.

The file `./utils/seeder.js` will contain the database seeding logic.
